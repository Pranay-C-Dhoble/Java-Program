//What is Collection In Java?
//A collection is a group of objects of the same type. Java provides Collection Framework which defines several classes and interfaces to represent a group of objects as a single unit.
//The Collection interface (java.util.Collection) and Map interface (java.util.Map) are the two main “root” interfaces of Java collection classes.

    //how to update arraylist in java?
    //ArrayList is a class in java.util package. It is used to create dynamic arrays. It inherits AbstractList class and implements List interface.
    //The important points about Java ArrayList class are:
    //Java ArrayList class can contain duplicate elements.
    //Java ArrayList class maintains insertion order.
    //Java ArrayList class is non synchronized.
    //Java ArrayList allows random access because array works at the index basis.
    //In Java ArrayList class, manipulation is slow because a lot of shifting needs to be occurred if any element is removed from the array list.
    //Java ArrayList is better for storing and accessing data.
    //Java ArrayList can be used in the place of an array.
    //Java ArrayList inherits AbstractList class and implements List interface.
    //Java ArrayList is initialized by a size, however, the size can increase if collection grows or shrunk if objects are removed from the collection.
    //Java ArrayList can be seen as a dynamic array having the ability to grow and shrink automatically.
    //Java ArrayList allows us to randomly access the list.
    //Java ArrayList can not be used for primitive types, like int, char, etc. We need a wrapper class for such cases (see this for details).
    //Java ArrayList may contain null values.
    //Java ArrayList is a way too slow as it internally uses an array. If you need a fast implementation of ArrayList, consider using FastUtil or Trove.
    //Java ArrayList is an ordered collection. It maintains the insertion order of the elements.



    //which one is best array or arraylist in java?
    //Array is a fixed length data structure whereas ArrayList is a variable length Collection class.
    //We cannot change length of array once created in Java but ArrayList can be changed.
    //We cannot store primitives in ArrayList, it can only store objects.
    //ArrayList provides more powerful insertion and searching mechanism than array.
    //ArrayList is part of Collection framework while array is not.





    //difference between collection and collections in java?
    //Collection is an interface while Collections is a class.
    //Collection is present in java.util package while Collections is present in java.util package.
    //Collection is a root interface while Collections is a utility class.
    //Collection interface provides a single method iterator() whereas Collections class provides a number of methods like min(), max(), reverse(), etc.
    //Collection interface provides methods to operate on group of objects. Collections class is a utility class that provides utility methods to operate on Collection objects.
